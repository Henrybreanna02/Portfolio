# Markdown Guide for Beginners

## Introduction
**What is Markdown?**

Markdown is a lightweight way to write text that can be easily converted into
formatted content (like bold, italics, headings, lists, etc.) for web pages, documents, and other
digital content.
It uses simple symbols (like #, *, and -) to format the text, making it easy to read and write
without needing complex tools. For example:

- "#" for a heading (like a title)
- "*" or "_" for italics
- "**" or "__" for bold text
