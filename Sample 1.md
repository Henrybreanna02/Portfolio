# Markdown Guide for Beginners

## Introduction

**What is Markdown?**

Markdown is a lightweight way to write text that can be easily converted into
formatted content (like bold, italics, headings, lists, etc.) for web pages, documents, and other
digital content.
It uses simple symbols (like #, *, and -) to format the text, making it easy to read and write
without needing complex tools. For example:

- "#" for a heading (like a title)
- "*" or "_" for italics
- "**" or "__" for bold text

## Markdown Syntax Guide

**Headers**

To create headers, prefix the text with the appropriate number of "#" symbols, for example:
* "#" Heading 1
* "##" Heading 2
* "###" Heading 3

**Basic Text Formatting**

* **Bold**: to bold text, add "**" before and after the text you would like bolded. For example, "**Text\**"
* *Italics*: to italicize text, add "*" before and after the text you would like italicized. For example, "\*Text\*"
* ~~Strikethrough~~: To strikethrough text, add "~~" before and after the text. For example, "\~~Text~~"
* Blockquotes: To add a blockquote, add "> " before the text you would like quoted. For example, "\>Markdown is fun!"
* Backslash use: Use a backslash before a syntax if you want to use symbols associated with other commands. For example, "*" are used for lists so if
you want to actually use *, write \*.

**Page Separation**

To separate sections on a page or to insert a horizontal line, use 3 hyphons without any space between or at the start or end.
* "---"

**Lists**

Ordered Lists:
* To numerically order a list, preface the first listed item with "1.". For example, "1. Item one".
* As you move to the next row by clicking **enter**, the numbering will automatically continue (2.,3.,4.).

*Sample*

A List of My Favorite Animals:
1. Dogs
2. Bunnies
3. Cats
4. Lions
5. Bears

Bulleted Lists:
* To start a bulleted list, preface the first listed item with "*". For example, "* Item one".
* As you move to the next row by clicking **enter**, the bullet points will automatically continue.

*Sample*

* Read
* Write
* Watch TV

* For example, "\[GitHub](https://github.com)"
